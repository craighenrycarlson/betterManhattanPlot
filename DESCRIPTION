Description: This function takes a dataframe of GWAS results as input, which requires columns named: "snp", "chr", "bp", and "p", and returns a Manhattan plot. This function assumes snp position is in base pairs "bp". Options are: genome-wide significance threshold, chromosome colors, and snps to highlight. A QQ-plot can also be generated with a vector of p-values.
